```yaml
"host": string
"trafficPolicy": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.TrafficPolicy
"subsets": []istio.networking.v1alpha3.Subset
"exportTo": []string

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `host` | `string` | The name of a service from the service registry. Service names are looked up from the platform's service registry (e.g., Kubernetes services, Consul services, etc.) and from the hosts declared by [ServiceEntries](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/service-entry/#ServiceEntry). Rules defined for services that do not exist in the service registry will be ignored. *Note for Kubernetes users*: When short names are used (e.g. "reviews" instead of "reviews.default.svc.cluster.local"), Istio will interpret the short name based on the namespace of the rule, not the service. A rule in the "default" namespace containing a host "reviews" will be interpreted as "reviews.default.svc.cluster.local", irrespective of the actual namespace associated with the reviews service. _To avoid potential misconfigurations, it is recommended to always use fully qualified domain names over short names._ Note that the host field applies to both HTTP and TCP services. |  |
| `trafficPolicy` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.TrafficPolicy](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#trafficpolicy) | Traffic policies to apply (load balancing policy, connection pool sizes, outlier detection). |  |
| `subsets` | [[]istio.networking.v1alpha3.Subset](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#subset) | One or more named sets that represent individual versions of a service. Traffic policies can be overridden at subset level. |  |
| `exportTo` | `[]string` | A list of namespaces to which this destination rule is exported. The resolution of a destination rule to apply to a service occurs in the context of a hierarchy of namespaces. Exporting a destination rule allows it to be included in the resolution hierarchy for services in other namespaces. This feature provides a mechanism for service owners and mesh administrators to control the visibility of destination rules across namespace boundaries. If no namespaces are specified then the destination rule is exported to all namespaces by default. The value "." is reserved and defines an export to the same namespace that the destination rule is declared in. Similarly, the value "*" is reserved and defines an export to all namespaces. NOTE: in the current release, the `exportTo` value is restricted to "." or "*" (i.e., the current namespace or all namespaces). |  |




---
### TrafficPolicy

 
Traffic policies to apply for a specific destination, across all
destination ports. See DestinationRule for examples.

```yaml
"loadBalancer": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.LoadBalancerSettings
"connectionPool": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.ConnectionPoolSettings
"outlierDetection": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.OutlierDetection
"tls": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.TLSSettings
"portLevelSettings": []istio.networking.v1alpha3.TrafficPolicy.PortTrafficPolicy

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `loadBalancer` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.LoadBalancerSettings](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#loadbalancersettings) | Settings controlling the load balancer algorithms. |  |
| `connectionPool` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.ConnectionPoolSettings](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#connectionpoolsettings) | Settings controlling the volume of connections to an upstream service. |  |
| `outlierDetection` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.OutlierDetection](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#outlierdetection) | Settings controlling eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool. |  |
| `tls` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.TLSSettings](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#tlssettings) | TLS related settings for connections to the upstream service. |  |
| `portLevelSettings` | [[]istio.networking.v1alpha3.TrafficPolicy.PortTrafficPolicy](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#porttrafficpolicy) | Traffic policies specific to individual ports. Note that port level settings will override the destination-level settings. Traffic settings specified at the destination-level will not be inherited when overridden by port-level settings, i.e. default values will be applied to fields omitted in port-level traffic policies. |  |




---
### PortTrafficPolicy

 
Traffic policies that apply to specific ports of the service

```yaml
"port": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.PortSelector
"loadBalancer": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.LoadBalancerSettings
"connectionPool": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.ConnectionPoolSettings
"outlierDetection": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.OutlierDetection
"tls": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.TLSSettings

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `port` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.PortSelector](../virtual_service.proto.sk/#portselector) | Specifies the number of a port on the destination service on which this policy is being applied. |  |
| `loadBalancer` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.LoadBalancerSettings](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#loadbalancersettings) | Settings controlling the load balancer algorithms. |  |
| `connectionPool` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.ConnectionPoolSettings](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#connectionpoolsettings) | Settings controlling the volume of connections to an upstream service. |  |
| `outlierDetection` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.OutlierDetection](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#outlierdetection) | Settings controlling eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool. |  |
| `tls` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.TLSSettings](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#tlssettings) | TLS related settings for connections to the upstream service. |  |




---
### Subset

 
A subset of endpoints of a service. Subsets can be used for scenarios
like A/B testing, or routing to a specific version of a service. Refer
to [VirtualService](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/#VirtualService) documentation for examples of using
subsets in these scenarios. In addition, traffic policies defined at the
service-level can be overridden at a subset-level. The following rule
uses a round robin load balancing policy for all traffic going to a
subset named testversion that is composed of endpoints (e.g., pods) with
labels (version:v3).

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-ratings
spec:
  host: ratings.prod.svc.cluster.local
  trafficPolicy:
    loadBalancer:
      simple: LEAST_CONN
  subsets:
  - name: testversion
    labels:
      version: v3
    trafficPolicy:
      loadBalancer:
        simple: ROUND_ROBIN
```

**Note:** Policies specified for subsets will not take effect until
a route rule explicitly sends traffic to this subset.

One or more labels are typically required to identify the subset destination,
however, when the corresponding DestinationRule represents a host that
supports multiple SNI hosts (e.g., an egress gateway), a subset without labels
may be meaningful. In this case a traffic policy with [TLSSettings](#TLSSettings)
can be used to identify a specific SNI host corresponding to the named subset.

```yaml
"name": string
"labels": map<string, string>
"trafficPolicy": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.TrafficPolicy

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `name` | `string` | Name of the subset. The service name and the subset name can be used for traffic splitting in a route rule. |  |
| `labels` | `map<string, string>` | Labels apply a filter over the endpoints of a service in the service registry. See route rules for examples of usage. |  |
| `trafficPolicy` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.TrafficPolicy](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#trafficpolicy) | Traffic policies that apply to this subset. Subsets inherit the traffic policies specified at the DestinationRule level. Settings specified at the subset level will override the corresponding settings specified at the DestinationRule level. |  |




---
### LoadBalancerSettings

 
Load balancing policies to apply for a specific destination. See Envoy's
load balancing
[documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/load_balancing)
for more details.

For example, the following rule uses a round robin load balancing policy
for all traffic going to the ratings service.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-ratings
spec:
  host: ratings.prod.svc.cluster.local
  trafficPolicy:
    loadBalancer:
      simple: ROUND_ROBIN
```

The following example sets up sticky sessions for the ratings service
hashing-based load balancer for the same ratings service using the
the User cookie as the hash key.

```yaml
 apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
 kind: DestinationRule
 metadata:
   name: bookinfo-ratings
 spec:
   host: ratings.prod.svc.cluster.local
   trafficPolicy:
     loadBalancer:
       consistentHash:
         httpCookie:
           name: user
           ttl: 0s
```

```yaml
"simple": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.LoadBalancerSettings.SimpleLB
"consistentHash": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.LoadBalancerSettings.ConsistentHashLB
"localityLbSetting": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.LocalityLoadBalancerSetting

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `simple` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.LoadBalancerSettings.SimpleLB](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#simplelb) |  Only one of `simple` or `consistentHash` can be set. |  |
| `consistentHash` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.LoadBalancerSettings.ConsistentHashLB](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#consistenthashlb) |  Only one of `consistentHash` or `simple` can be set. |  |
| `localityLbSetting` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.LocalityLoadBalancerSetting](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#localityloadbalancersetting) | Locality load balancer settings, this will override mesh wide settings in entirety, meaning no merging would be performed between this object and the object one in MeshConfig. |  |




---
### ConsistentHashLB

 
Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to provide soft
session affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other
properties. This load balancing policy is applicable only for HTTP
connections. The affinity to a particular destination host will be
lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the destination
service.

```yaml
"httpHeaderName": string
"httpCookie": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.LoadBalancerSettings.ConsistentHashLB.HTTPCookie
"useSourceIp": bool
"minimumRingSize": int

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `httpHeaderName` | `string` | Hash based on a specific HTTP header. Only one of `httpHeaderName`, or `useSourceIp` can be set. |  |
| `httpCookie` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.LoadBalancerSettings.ConsistentHashLB.HTTPCookie](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#httpcookie) | Hash based on HTTP cookie. Only one of `httpCookie`, or `useSourceIp` can be set. |  |
| `useSourceIp` | `bool` | Hash based on the source IP address. Only one of `useSourceIp`, or `httpCookie` can be set. |  |
| `minimumRingSize` | `int` | The minimum number of virtual nodes to use for the hash ring. Defaults to 1024. Larger ring sizes result in more granular load distributions. If the number of hosts in the load balancing pool is larger than the ring size, each host will be assigned a single virtual node. |  |




---
### HTTPCookie

 
Describes a HTTP cookie that will be used as the hash key for the
Consistent Hash load balancer. If the cookie is not present, it will
be generated.

```yaml
"name": string
"path": string
"ttl": .google.protobuf.Duration

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `name` | `string` | Name of the cookie. |  |
| `path` | `string` | Path to set for the cookie. |  |
| `ttl` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | Lifetime of the cookie. |  |




---
### SimpleLB

 
Standard load balancing algorithms that require no tuning.

| Name | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| `ROUND_ROBIN` | Round Robin policy. Default |
| `LEAST_CONN` | The least request load balancer uses an O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests. |
| `RANDOM` | The random load balancer selects a random healthy host. The random load balancer generally performs better than round robin if no health checking policy is configured. |
| `PASSTHROUGH` | This option will forward the connection to the original IP address requested by the caller without doing any form of load balancing. This option must be used with care. It is meant for advanced use cases. Refer to Original Destination load balancer in Envoy for further details. |




---
### ConnectionPoolSettings

 
Connection pool settings for an upstream host. The settings apply to
each individual host in the upstream service.  See Envoy's [circuit
breaker](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/circuit_breaking)
for more details. Connection pool settings can be applied at the TCP
level as well as at HTTP level.

For example, the following rule sets a limit of 100 connections to redis
service called myredissrv with a connect timeout of 30ms

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-redis
spec:
  host: myredissrv.prod.svc.cluster.local
  trafficPolicy:
    connectionPool:
      tcp:
        maxConnections: 100
        connectTimeout: 30ms
        tcpKeepalive:
          time: 7200s
          interval: 75s
```

```yaml
"tcp": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.ConnectionPoolSettings.TCPSettings
"http": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.ConnectionPoolSettings.HTTPSettings

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `tcp` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.ConnectionPoolSettings.TCPSettings](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#tcpsettings) | Settings common to both HTTP and TCP upstream connections. |  |
| `http` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.ConnectionPoolSettings.HTTPSettings](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#httpsettings) | HTTP connection pool settings. |  |




---
### TCPSettings

 
Settings common to both HTTP and TCP upstream connections.

```yaml
"maxConnections": int
"connectTimeout": .google.protobuf.Duration
"tcpKeepalive": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.ConnectionPoolSettings.TCPSettings.TcpKeepalive

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `maxConnections` | `int` | Maximum number of HTTP1 /TCP connections to a destination host. Default 1024. |  |
| `connectTimeout` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | TCP connection timeout. |  |
| `tcpKeepalive` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.ConnectionPoolSettings.TCPSettings.TcpKeepalive](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#tcpkeepalive) | If set then set SO_KEEPALIVE on the socket to enable TCP Keepalives. |  |




---
### TcpKeepalive

 
TCP keepalive.

```yaml
"probes": int
"time": .google.protobuf.Duration
"interval": .google.protobuf.Duration

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `probes` | `int` | Maximum number of keepalive probes to send without response before deciding the connection is dead. Default is to use the OS level configuration (unless overridden, Linux defaults to 9.). |  |
| `time` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | The time duration a connection needs to be idle before keep-alive probes start being sent. Default is to use the OS level configuration (unless overridden, Linux defaults to 7200s (ie 2 hours.). |  |
| `interval` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | The time duration between keep-alive probes. Default is to use the OS level configuration (unless overridden, Linux defaults to 75s.). |  |




---
### HTTPSettings

 
Settings applicable to HTTP1.1/HTTP2/GRPC connections.

```yaml
"http1MaxPendingRequests": int
"http2MaxRequests": int
"maxRequestsPerConnection": int
"maxRetries": int
"idleTimeout": .google.protobuf.Duration
"h2UpgradePolicy": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.ConnectionPoolSettings.HTTPSettings.H2UpgradePolicy

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `http1MaxPendingRequests` | `int` | Maximum number of pending HTTP requests to a destination. Default 1024. |  |
| `http2MaxRequests` | `int` | Maximum number of requests to a backend. Default 1024. |  |
| `maxRequestsPerConnection` | `int` | Maximum number of requests per connection to a backend. Setting this parameter to 1 disables keep alive. Default 0, meaning "unlimited", up to 2^29. |  |
| `maxRetries` | `int` | Maximum number of retries that can be outstanding to all hosts in a cluster at a given time. Defaults to 1024. |  |
| `idleTimeout` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | The idle timeout for upstream connection pool connections. The idle timeout is defined as the period in which there are no active requests. If not set, the default is 1 hour. When the idle timeout is reached the connection will be closed. Note that request based timeouts mean that HTTP/2 PINGs will not keep the connection alive. Applies to both HTTP1.1 and HTTP2 connections. |  |
| `h2UpgradePolicy` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.ConnectionPoolSettings.HTTPSettings.H2UpgradePolicy](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#h2upgradepolicy) | Specify if http1.1 connection should be upgraded to http2 for the associated destination. |  |




---
### H2UpgradePolicy

 
Policy for upgrading http1.1 connections to http2.

| Name | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| `DEFAULT` | Use the global default. |
| `DO_NOT_UPGRADE` | Do not upgrade the connection to http2. This opt-out option overrides the default. |
| `UPGRADE` | Upgrade the connection to http2. This opt-in option overrides the default. |




---
### OutlierDetection

 
A Circuit breaker implementation that tracks the status of each
individual host in the upstream service.  Applicable to both HTTP and
TCP services.  For HTTP services, hosts that continually return 5xx
errors for API calls are ejected from the pool for a pre-defined period
of time. For TCP services, connection timeouts or connection
failures to a given host counts as an error when measuring the
consecutive errors metric. See Envoy's [outlier
detection](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/outlier)
for more details.

The following rule sets a connection pool size of 100 HTTP1 connections
with no more than 10 req/connection to the "reviews" service. In addition,
it sets a limit of 1000 concurrent HTTP2 requests and configures upstream
hosts to be scanned every 5 mins so that any host that fails 7 consecutive
times with a 502, 503, or 504 error code will be ejected for 15 minutes.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews-cb-policy
spec:
  host: reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
  trafficPolicy:
    connectionPool:
      tcp:
        maxConnections: 100
      http:
        http2MaxRequests: 1000
        maxRequestsPerConnection: 10
    outlierDetection:
      consecutiveErrors: 7
      interval: 5m
      baseEjectionTime: 15m
```

```yaml
"consecutiveErrors": int
"interval": .google.protobuf.Duration
"baseEjectionTime": .google.protobuf.Duration
"maxEjectionPercent": int
"minHealthPercent": int

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `consecutiveErrors` | `int` | Number of errors before a host is ejected from the connection pool. Defaults to 5. When the upstream host is accessed over HTTP, a 502, 503, or 504 return code qualifies as an error. When the upstream host is accessed over an opaque TCP connection, connect timeouts and connection error/failure events qualify as an error. |  |
| `interval` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | Time interval between ejection sweep analysis. format: 1h/1m/1s/1ms. MUST BE >=1ms. Default is 10s. |  |
| `baseEjectionTime` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | Minimum ejection duration. A host will remain ejected for a period equal to the product of minimum ejection duration and the number of times the host has been ejected. This technique allows the system to automatically increase the ejection period for unhealthy upstream servers. format: 1h/1m/1s/1ms. MUST BE >=1ms. Default is 30s. |  |
| `maxEjectionPercent` | `int` | Maximum % of hosts in the load balancing pool for the upstream service that can be ejected. Defaults to 10%. |  |
| `minHealthPercent` | `int` | Outlier detection will be enabled as long as the associated load balancing pool has at least min_health_percent hosts in healthy mode. When the percentage of healthy hosts in the load balancing pool drops below this threshold, outlier detection will be disabled and the proxy will load balance across all hosts in the pool (healthy and unhealthy). The threshold can be disabled by setting it to 0%. The default is 0% as it's not typically applicable in k8s environments with few pods per service. |  |




---
### TLSSettings

 
SSL/TLS related settings for upstream connections. See Envoy's [TLS
context](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/api/v2/auth/cert.proto.html)
for more details. These settings are common to both HTTP and TCP upstreams.

For example, the following rule configures a client to use mutual TLS
for connections to upstream database cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: db-mtls
spec:
  host: mydbserver.prod.svc.cluster.local
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: MUTUAL
      clientCertificate: /etc/certs/myclientcert.pem
      privateKey: /etc/certs/client_private_key.pem
      caCertificates: /etc/certs/rootcacerts.pem
```

The following rule configures a client to use TLS when talking to a
foreign service whose domain matches *.foo.com.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: tls-foo
spec:
  host: "*.foo.com"
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: SIMPLE
```

The following rule configures a client to use Istio mutual TLS when talking
to rating services.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: ratings-istio-mtls
spec:
  host: ratings.prod.svc.cluster.local
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL
```

```yaml
"mode": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.TLSSettings.TLSmode
"clientCertificate": string
"privateKey": string
"caCertificates": string
"subjectAltNames": []string
"sni": string

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `mode` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.TLSSettings.TLSmode](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#tlsmode) | Indicates whether connections to this port should be secured using TLS. The value of this field determines how TLS is enforced. |  |
| `clientCertificate` | `string` | REQUIRED if mode is `MUTUAL`. The path to the file holding the client-side TLS certificate to use. Should be empty if mode is `ISTIO_MUTUAL`. |  |
| `privateKey` | `string` | REQUIRED if mode is `MUTUAL`. The path to the file holding the client's private key. Should be empty if mode is `ISTIO_MUTUAL`. |  |
| `caCertificates` | `string` | OPTIONAL: The path to the file containing certificate authority certificates to use in verifying a presented server certificate. If omitted, the proxy will not verify the server's certificate. Should be empty if mode is `ISTIO_MUTUAL`. |  |
| `subjectAltNames` | `[]string` | A list of alternate names to verify the subject identity in the certificate. If specified, the proxy will verify that the server certificate's subject alt name matches one of the specified values. If specified, this list overrides the value of subject_alt_names from the ServiceEntry. |  |
| `sni` | `string` | SNI string to present to the server during TLS handshake. |  |




---
### TLSmode

 
TLS connection mode

| Name | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| `DISABLE` | Do not setup a TLS connection to the upstream endpoint. |
| `SIMPLE` | Originate a TLS connection to the upstream endpoint. |
| `MUTUAL` | Secure connections to the upstream using mutual TLS by presenting client certificates for authentication. |
| `ISTIO_MUTUAL` | Secure connections to the upstream using mutual TLS by presenting client certificates for authentication. Compared to Mutual mode, this mode uses certificates generated automatically by Istio for mTLS authentication. When this mode is used, all other fields in `TLSSettings` should be empty. |




---
### LocalityLoadBalancerSetting

 
Locality-weighted load balancing allows administrators to control the
distribution of traffic to endpoints based on the localities of where the
traffic originates and where it will terminate. These localities are
specified using arbitrary labels that designate a hierarchy of localities in
{region}/{zone}/{sub-zone} form. For additional detail refer to
[Locality Weight](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/locality_weight)
The following example shows how to setup locality weights mesh-wide.

Given a mesh with workloads and their service deployed to "us-west/zone1/*"
and "us-west/zone2/*". This example specifies that when traffic accessing a
service originates from workloads in "us-west/zone1/*", 80% of the traffic
will be sent to endpoints in "us-west/zone1/*", i.e the same zone, and the
remaining 20% will go to endpoints in "us-west/zone2/*". This setup is
intended to favor routing traffic to endpoints in the same locality.
A similar setting is specified for traffic originating in "us-west/zone2/*".

```yaml
  distribute:
    - from: us-west/zone1/*
      to:
        "us-west/zone1/*": 80
        "us-west/zone2/*": 20
    - from: us-west/zone2/*
      to:
        "us-west/zone1/*": 20
        "us-west/zone2/*": 80
```

If the goal of the operator is not to distribute load across zones and
regions but rather to restrict the regionality of failover to meet other
operational requirements an operator can set a 'failover' policy instead of
a 'distribute' policy.

The following example sets up a locality failover policy for regions.
Assume a service resides in zones within us-east, us-west & eu-west
this example specifies that when endpoints within us-east become unhealthy
traffic should failover to endpoints in any zone or sub-zone within eu-west
and similarly us-west should failover to us-east.

```yaml
 failover:
   - from: us-east
     to: eu-west
   - from: us-west
     to: us-east
```
Locality load balancing settings.

```yaml
"distribute": []istio.networking.v1alpha3.LocalityLoadBalancerSetting.Distribute
"failover": []istio.networking.v1alpha3.LocalityLoadBalancerSetting.Failover

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `distribute` | [[]istio.networking.v1alpha3.LocalityLoadBalancerSetting.Distribute](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#distribute) | Optional: only one of distribute or failover can be set. Explicitly specify loadbalancing weight across different zones and geographical locations. Refer to [Locality weighted load balancing](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/locality_weight) If empty, the locality weight is set according to the endpoints number within it. |  |
| `failover` | [[]istio.networking.v1alpha3.LocalityLoadBalancerSetting.Failover](../destination_rule.proto.sk/#failover) | Optional: only failover or distribute can be set. Explicitly specify the region traffic will land on when endpoints in local region becomes unhealthy. Should be used together with OutlierDetection to detect unhealthy endpoints. Note: if no OutlierDetection specified, this will not take effect. |  |

### Distribute

 
Describes how traffic originating in the 'from' zone or sub-zone is
distributed over a set of 'to' zones. Syntax for specifying a zone is
{region}/{zone}/{sub-zone} and terminal wildcards are allowed on any
segment of the specification. Examples:
* - matches all localities
us-west/* - all zones and sub-zones within the us-west region
us-west/zone-1/* - all sub-zones within us-west/zone-1

```yaml
"from": string
"to": map<string, int>

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `from` | `string` | Originating locality, '/' separated, e.g. 'region/zone/sub_zone'. |  |
| `to` | `map<string, int>` | Map of upstream localities to traffic distribution weights. The sum of all weights should be == 100. Any locality not assigned a weight will receive no traffic. |  |




---
### Failover

 
Specify the traffic failover policy across regions. Since zone and sub-zone
failover is supported by default this only needs to be specified for
regions when the operator needs to constrain traffic failover so that
the default behavior of failing over to any endpoint globally does not
apply. This is useful when failing over traffic across regions would not
improve service health or may need to be restricted for other reasons
like regulatory controls.

```yaml
"from": string
"to": string

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `from` | `string` | Originating region. |  |
| `to` | `string` | Destination region the traffic will fail over to when endpoints in the 'from' region becomes unhealthy. |  |
