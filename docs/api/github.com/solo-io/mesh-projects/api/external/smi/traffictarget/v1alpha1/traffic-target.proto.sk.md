### TrafficTarget

 
TrafficTarget associates a set of traffic definitions (rules) with a service identity which is allocated to a group of pods.
Access is controlled via referenced TrafficSpecs and by a list of source service identities.
* If a pod which holds the referenced service identity makes a call to the destination on one of the defined routes then access
  will be allowed
* Any pod which attempts to connect and is not in the defined list of sources will be denied
* Any pod which is in the defined list, but attempts to connect on a route which is not in the list of the
  TrafficSpecs will be denied
