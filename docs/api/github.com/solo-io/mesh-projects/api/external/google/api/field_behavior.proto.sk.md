### FieldBehavior

Description: An indicator of the behavior of a given field (for example, that a field
is required in requests, or given as output but ignored as input).
This **does not** change the behavior in protocol buffers itself; it only
denotes the behavior and may affect how API tooling handles the field.

Note: This enum **may** receive new values in the future.

| Name | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| FIELD_BEHAVIOR_UNSPECIFIED | Conventional default for enums. Do not use this. |
| OPTIONAL | Specifically denotes a field as optional. While all fields in protocol buffers are optional, this may be specified for emphasis if appropriate. |
| REQUIRED | Denotes a field as required. This indicates that the field **must** be provided as part of the request, and failure to do so will cause an error (usually `INVALID_ARGUMENT`). |
| OUTPUT_ONLY | Denotes a field as output only. This indicates that the field is provided in responses, but including the field in a request does nothing (the server *must* ignore it and *must not* throw an error as a result of the field's presence). |
| INPUT_ONLY | Denotes a field as input only. This indicates that the field is provided in requests, and the corresponding field is not included in output. |
| IMMUTABLE | Denotes a field as immutable. This indicates that the field may be set once in a request to create a resource, but may not be changed thereafter. |
