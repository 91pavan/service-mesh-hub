### ServiceEntry



```yaml
"status": .core.solo.io.Status
"metadata": .core.solo.io.Metadata
"hosts": []string
"addresses": []string
"ports": []istio.networking.v1alpha3.Port
"location": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.ServiceEntry.Location
"resolution": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.ServiceEntry.Resolution
"endpoints": []istio.networking.v1alpha3.ServiceEntry.Endpoint
"exportTo": []string
"subjectAltNames": []string

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `status` | [.core.solo.io.Status](../../../../../../../solo-kit/api/v1/status.proto.sk/#status) | Status indicates the validation status of this resource. Status is read-only by clients, and set by supergloo during validation. |  |
| `metadata` | [.core.solo.io.Metadata](../../../../../../../solo-kit/api/v1/metadata.proto.sk/#metadata) | Metadata contains the object metadata for this resource. |  |
| `hosts` | `[]string` | REQUIRED. The hosts associated with the ServiceEntry. Could be a DNS name with wildcard prefix. 1. The hosts field is used to select matching hosts in VirtualServices and DestinationRules. 2. For HTTP traffic the HTTP Host/Authority header will be matched against the hosts field. 3. For HTTPs or TLS traffic containing Server Name Indication (SNI), the SNI value will be matched against the hosts field. Note that when resolution is set to type DNS and no endpoints are specified, the host field will be used as the DNS name of the endpoint to route traffic to. |  |
| `addresses` | `[]string` | The virtual IP addresses associated with the service. Could be CIDR prefix. For HTTP traffic, generated route configurations will include http route domains for both the `addresses` and `hosts` field values and the destination will be identified based on the HTTP Host/Authority header. If one or more IP addresses are specified, the incoming traffic will be identified as belonging to this service if the destination IP matches the IP/CIDRs specified in the addresses field. If the Addresses field is empty, traffic will be identified solely based on the destination port. In such scenarios, the port on which the service is being accessed must not be shared by any other service in the mesh. In other words, the sidecar will behave as a simple TCP proxy, forwarding incoming traffic on a specified port to the specified destination endpoint IP/host. Unix domain socket addresses are not supported in this field. |  |
| `ports` | [[]istio.networking.v1alpha3.Port](../gateway.proto.sk/#port) | REQUIRED. The ports associated with the external service. If the Endpoints are Unix domain socket addresses, there must be exactly one port. |  |
| `location` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.ServiceEntry.Location](../service_entry.proto.sk/#location) | Specify whether the service should be considered external to the mesh or part of the mesh. |  |
| `resolution` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.ServiceEntry.Resolution](../service_entry.proto.sk/#resolution) | REQUIRED: Service discovery mode for the hosts. Care must be taken when setting the resolution mode to NONE for a TCP port without accompanying IP addresses. In such cases, traffic to any IP on said port will be allowed (i.e. 0.0.0.0:<port>). |  |
| `endpoints` | [[]istio.networking.v1alpha3.ServiceEntry.Endpoint](../service_entry.proto.sk/#endpoint) | One or more endpoints associated with the service. |  |
| `exportTo` | `[]string` | A list of namespaces to which this service is exported. Exporting a service allows it to be used by sidecars, gateways and virtual services defined in other namespaces. This feature provides a mechanism for service owners and mesh administrators to control the visibility of services across namespace boundaries. If no namespaces are specified then the service is exported to all namespaces by default. The value "." is reserved and defines an export to the same namespace that the service is declared in. Similarly the value "*" is reserved and defines an export to all namespaces. For a Kubernetes Service, the equivalent effect can be achieved by setting the annotation "networking.istio.io/exportTo" to a comma-separated list of namespace names. NOTE: in the current release, the `exportTo` value is restricted to "." or "*" (i.e., the current namespace or all namespaces). |  |
| `subjectAltNames` | `[]string` | The list of subject alternate names allowed for workload instances that implement this service. This information is used to enforce [secure-naming](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/security/#secure-naming). If specified, the proxy will verify that the server certificate's subject alternate name matches one of the specified values. |  |

### Endpoint

 
Endpoint defines a network address (IP or hostname) associated with
the mesh service.

```yaml
"address": string
"ports": map<string, int>
"labels": map<string, string>
"network": string
"locality": string
"weight": int

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `address` | `string` | REQUIRED: Address associated with the network endpoint without the port. Domain names can be used if and only if the resolution is set to DNS, and must be fully-qualified without wildcards. Use the form unix:///absolute/path/to/socket for Unix domain socket endpoints. |  |
| `ports` | `map<string, int>` | Set of ports associated with the endpoint. The ports must be associated with a port name that was declared as part of the service. Do not use for `unix://` addresses. |  |
| `labels` | `map<string, string>` | One or more labels associated with the endpoint. |  |
| `network` | `string` | Network enables Istio to group endpoints resident in the same L3 domain/network. All endpoints in the same network are assumed to be directly reachable from one another. When endpoints in different networks cannot reach each other directly, an Istio Gateway can be used to establish connectivity (usually using the AUTO_PASSTHROUGH mode in a Gateway Server). This is an advanced configuration used typically for spanning an Istio mesh over multiple clusters. |  |
| `locality` | `string` | The locality associated with the endpoint. A locality corresponds to a failure domain (e.g., country/region/zone). Arbitrary failure domain hierarchies can be represented by separating each encapsulating failure domain by /. For example, the locality of an an endpoint in US, in US-East-1 region, within availability zone az-1, in data center rack r11 can be represented as us/us-east-1/az-1/r11. Istio will configure the sidecar to route to endpoints within the same locality as the sidecar. If none of the endpoints in the locality are available, endpoints parent locality (but within the same network ID) will be chosen. For example, if there are two endpoints in same network (networkID "n1"), say e1 with locality us/us-east-1/az-1/r11 and e2 with locality us/us-east-1/az-2/r12, a sidecar from us/us-east-1/az-1/r11 locality will prefer e1 from the same locality over e2 from a different locality. Endpoint e2 could be the IP associated with a gateway (that bridges networks n1 and n2), or the IP associated with a standard service endpoint. |  |
| `weight` | `int` | The load balancing weight associated with the endpoint. Endpoints with higher weights will receive proportionally higher traffic. |  |




---
### Location

 
Location specifies whether the service is part of Istio mesh or
outside the mesh.  Location determines the behavior of several
features, such as service-to-service mTLS authentication, policy
enforcement, etc. When communicating with services outside the mesh,
Istio's mTLS authentication is disabled, and policy enforcement is
performed on the client-side as opposed to server-side.

| Name | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| `MESH_EXTERNAL` | Signifies that the service is external to the mesh. Typically used to indicate external services consumed through APIs. |
| `MESH_INTERNAL` | Signifies that the service is part of the mesh. Typically used to indicate services added explicitly as part of expanding the service mesh to include unmanaged infrastructure (e.g., VMs added to a Kubernetes based service mesh). |




---
### Resolution

 
Resolution determines how the proxy will resolve the IP addresses of
the network endpoints associated with the service, so that it can
route to one of them. The resolution mode specified here has no impact
on how the application resolves the IP address associated with the
service. The application may still have to use DNS to resolve the
service to an IP so that the outbound traffic can be captured by the
Proxy. Alternatively, for HTTP services, the application could
directly communicate with the proxy (e.g., by setting HTTP_PROXY) to
talk to these services.

| Name | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| `NONE` | Assume that incoming connections have already been resolved (to a specific destination IP address). Such connections are typically routed via the proxy using mechanisms such as IP table REDIRECT/ eBPF. After performing any routing related transformations, the proxy will forward the connection to the IP address to which the connection was bound. |
| `STATIC` | Use the static IP addresses specified in endpoints (see below) as the backing instances associated with the service. |
| `DNS` | Attempt to resolve the IP address by querying the ambient DNS, during request processing. If no endpoints are specified, the proxy will resolve the DNS address specified in the hosts field, if wildcards are not used. If endpoints are specified, the DNS addresses specified in the endpoints will be resolved to determine the destination IP address. DNS resolution cannot be used with Unix domain socket endpoints. |
